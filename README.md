# IMAGE_EDITOR
AI Image Editor built with Next.js/React/TypeScript. Users upload an image and type natural-language commands. Background removal , black &amp; white, warm tone, and watercolor run locally. Other prompts fall back to the first available provider (OpenAI/Gemini/Replicate/fal). API route orchestrates; components handle upload, prompt, and result display.
